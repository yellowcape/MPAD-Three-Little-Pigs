But while he was climbing onto the roof, Hog's mind drifted off elsewhere… With a daring heart, Hog prepared for the wolf's inevitable descent. As the wolf descended into the depths of the chimney, his snarls echoing against the narrow walls, he braced himself for the anticipated con- frontation. Yet, to his astonishment, he found himself in a dark room, with only the moonlight providing any light.

As he prepared to unleash his fury, the little pig's gaze held him captive, and in an act both bold and unexpected, the pig leaned forward and pressed his lips against the wolf's lips.
